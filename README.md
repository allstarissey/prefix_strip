# prefix_strip
Simply strips or replaces prefixes from file (or directory) paths.

## Usage
* `-p` flag manually specifies a prefix. Without the `-p` flag, the longest common prefix is used as a prefix.
* `-s` manually specifies the desired directory from which to source the file list.
* `-d` includes directories in the file list.
* `-y` skips the confirmation prompt.
* `-r` specifies a string to replace the prefix with.
